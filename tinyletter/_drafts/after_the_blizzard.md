title: The Programs of the Week After the Blizzard

This Week's Program: Jan 25 - Jan 29
====================================

"My name is Jonas," said the Blizzard that dropped a large amount of
snow on New York City last weekend. Saturday was lovely. We should
look more often for excuses to get cars off the roads, walk in the
streets, and curl up inside with our loved ones, large amounts of
bottled water, and a good book. Thanks for all you've shown us.

This week ended up being kind of a dud for writing code. I knew I
needed to take a break from
[*sonic-sketches*](https://github.com/mwunsch/sonic-sketches) to
formulate what I wanted to do next.

Fresh out of batteries, but still making noise<br />
