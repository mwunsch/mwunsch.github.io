title: The Programs of the Week of ⚡ Cyber Monday ⚡
---

This Week's Program: Nov 30 - Dec 4
===================================

It seems silly that we call a day "Cyber Monday." Truly, all of our
days are Cyber. I've picked up some new subscribers (Welcome) and I
thought it'd be nice to remind everyone (including myself) what this
newsletter is about.

This newsletter is about Living a Cyber Life™. Not so long ago I
started
[a practice](http://blog.markwunsch.com/post/130293473700/the-streak)
of writing and committing code every weekday. This newsletter is both
a forcing function to make sure I keep on doing that and a means to
compose and articulate my thoughts and goals for a given project. And
heck who says we can't have fun, too? Also, I compose this email in
Emacs and with a git
[pre-push hook](http://www.markwunsch.com/tinyletter/2015/10/second_week.html),
publish it through TinyLetter. Drafting and publishing this email
counts toward my code streak. Any accusations that I'm cheating will
result in me feeling bad about myself more than I already do so please
just don't.

The focus of my attention for the past several weeks has been a
repository called
[`sonic-sketches`](https://github.com/mwunsch/sonic-sketches), where
I'm getting more familiar with **Clojure** development through the
lens of [Overtone](http://overtone.github.io/), the audio environment
and client for the [SuperCollider](http://supercollider.github.io/)
synthesis engine.

I hope everyone had a pleasant Thanksgiving, but it's over now and
it's time to shop and computer. Put on your
[favorite Christmas music](https://open.spotify.com/user/mwunsch/playlist/3q6DSauAcKSTaEHBYb69mM)
and let's talk live coding for audio synthesis.

...

## Code that I did not commit: Let's Encrypt!

This Thursday, [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) entered
Public Beta. I want to encrypt!

+ I do not understand SSL/TLS any acronomy that ends in "S".
+ Docker is a thing.
+ AWS yeah sure okay.

None of this requires me committing code, just futzing on the command line.
