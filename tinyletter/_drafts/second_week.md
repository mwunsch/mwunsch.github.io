This Week's Program: Oct 5 - Oct 9

This week, email was on my mind. I'm fascinated with TinyLetter. Not just
because it facilitates a new (old) form of creative expression. It's also
because the systems that make email happen are neat. Having spent nearly my
entire career speaking HTTP to different computers, it was time to try a new
protocol: [SMTP](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5321).
