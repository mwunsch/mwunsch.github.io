This Week's Program: Dec 28 - Jan 1 2016
========================================

ðŸŽŠ **Happy New Year!** ðŸŽ†

Last week I hastily reviewed my code in 2015. Now I'd like to hastily
review the code I would like to write in the coming year. I approach
projects by the programming language or paradigm I'd like to explore,
using the features of the language to better understand certain
domains and using my curiosity of certain domains to justify
experimenting with certain languages.

## In 2015 I Did

+ **Emacs Lisp**
+ **Clojure**

2015 was a big year for me and parentheses. Lisps, in all their
incarnations, are glorious languages and anybody who makes parentheses
jokes instead of [learning a Lisp][brave-and-true] is a thirsty sonofabitch. 2015 is the
deepest I've dived into Clojure and it is a good language; one
that I hope to continue to use for general purpose programming. Making
the switch to Emacs was a good decision.

## In 2016 I Will

+ **Elm**
+ **Rust**
+ **Racket**
+ **Elixir**
+ **Haskell**
+ **ClojureScript**

This is an ambitious list and I do not expect to complete these
explorations by 2017.

## In 2016 I Might

+ **Swift**. Mac and iOS development are tantalizing, especially now
  with what appears at first glance to be a really thoughtfully
  designed, modern language. I don't think Apple is going anywhere,
  and I've held off for this long. Would be fun though, and, more than
  the other languages, would pad my rÃ©sumÃ©.
+ **Pharo**.
+ **Go**. Doesn't excite me much.

## In 2016 I Won't

+ A language for data science. Something like **R**, **Julia** or even
  **Python**. I own a license for **Mathematica** and I think it's a
  really cool environment but this is not a domain I'm going to be
  focusing on in 2016.
+ A logic or concatenative programming language. **Prolog** is a
  really compelling way of thinking about programming, but with
  [core.logic](https://github.com/clojure/core.logic) I've found a way
  to temporarily scratch this itch. I'd like to revisit Prolog
  in 2017. Same for [**Mozart-Oz**](http://mozart.github.io/), which I
  know very little about. [**Factor**](http://factorcode.org/) looks
  like a cool language, too.
