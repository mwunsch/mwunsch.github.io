This Week's Program: Sep 12 - Sep 16
====================================

Hello! I'm writing this over the course of an Engineering Management
workshop program. This newsletter is all about my little escape from
Engineering Management, but it's important to also, you know, _work_
and think about _working better_. So that's what I'm up to today.

I decided to take this week off from my code streak to collect my
thoughts from XOXO. At the XOXO `#bots` social meetup, I got to
present my work on `sonic-sketches`. I was so glad to be a part of
that! My bot even made it to The Verge's
[_Best of XOXO_](http://www.theverge.com/2016/9/11/12881398/xoxo-fest-2016-best-of)
list. Cool!

## My Best of XOXO

1. [Sammus](https://sammusmusic.com/)'s discussion about tears and why
   it's okay to shed them, followed by an awesome acapella performance
   and some talk on the merits of sharing your vulnerability. It was
   incredibly moving. It was at this moment where I realized what XOXO
   is really about. It's not a tech conference or an art conference or
   a professional networking event. XOXO is a symposium on following
   your creative spirit and being honest with it through pain and
   criticism and in the face of external judgement. It's about
   self-care in the pursuit of your need for creative expression, and
   how that pursuit is in itself a form of self-care.
2. [Starlee Kine](https://gimletmedia.com/show/mystery-show/) talked
   about her relationship to her listeners and balancing their desire
   for more _content_ with her own creative desires. This was a
   recurring topic throughout the conference: the relationship and
   dialog between a _content_-creator and their audience. It can be
   demanding. What was really cool is that I got to catch up with
   Starlee at the conference's final party. She also happened to
   participate in an art project by Miranda July and Paul Ford from
   the [Rhizome Seven on Seven](http://sevenonseven.rhizome.org/)
   conference earlier this year. In this project, Starlee assisted in
   [stalking everyone in the audience.](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/miranda-july-and-paul-ford-cyberstalked-me)
   It was great. Starlee recognized both my wife and I on sight and
   laughs were had. She's a good detective.
3. [John Roderick](https://twitter.com/johnroderick) offered what I
   think was my favorite talk of the event. He spoke about the
   perception of effortlessness and how damaging that was to his
   beliefs about how "effortless" his creative work should seem, and
   the subsequent guilt he felt when he started podcasting and things
   _did_ feel effortless. He spoke about "contentedness" and why he's
   the type who can never feel contented. His talk spoke to something
   angry and cynical and bitter that lay deep inside me and I
   appreciated what he had to say. I just started the episode of
   [Roderick on the Line](http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick/ep-216-you-could-do-less-magic.html)
   following the conference and so far it's a great postscript.
3. [Lucy Bellwood](https://lucybellwood.com/), a comic artist who I
   wasn't familiar with, gave a heart-wrenching, vulnerable talk about
   her own financial stability. This was another recurring theme of
   the conference: size of audience does not have a direct
   relationship with financial growth. She was great.
4. [_Don't Hug Me I'm Scared_](https://www.youtube.com/user/thisisitcollective)
   is a brilliant film series that should be watched serially in its
   entirety. My wife and I quoted it for the rest of the
   conference. It's hilarious and disturbing. Like David Lynch meets
   Pee Wee's Playhouse.
5. [_Two More Eggs_](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLg6R6yXKSLYDm2piDZL8n22qlt_olZUeJ)
   by The Brothers Chaps. A series of short cartoons produced by
   Disney from the same guys who created Homestar Runner. Was so cool
   to see Homestar Runner on the stage at XOXO but I really loved
   these shorts, and to see how much leash Disney had given them.
6. [Jenn Schiffer](https://medium.com/cool-code-pal) was hilarious and
   raised so many important points about the way men rush to judge and
   criticize and explain something to a woman. Meanwhile, a
   well-respected leader in our industry is a literal vampire and
   somehow that's okay.
7. [David Rees](http://www.artisanalpencilsharpening.com/) gave a
   great and vulnerable talk about his financial struggles and touched
   on all of the previously stated themes of the conference.
8. [Sarah Jeong](https://twitter.com/sarahjeong) gave a talk about ad
   blockers and the identity crisis they present to the media
   industry. This one was great because Vera, my wife, is a product
   manager for [Ghostery](http://ghostery.com/) and had just, days
   earlier, released the latest version of their browser
   extension. She worked really hard on it and it is awesome and Sarah
   nailed why its existence is so necessary.

So that's my non-exhaustive
list. [Tantek](http://tantek.com/2016/257/b1/xoxofest-overviews-personal-perspectives)
has collected a bunch of other people's writing and perspectives of
the festival. You should check this all out and watch the conference
videos when they are eventually released. It was a fantastic
experience and Portland is a great place.

## Next Week…

It's back to working on `hive-city`. I'm trying to learn enough about
SVG to render something reasonably interesting to look at. Here are
some resources that are helping me with that:
