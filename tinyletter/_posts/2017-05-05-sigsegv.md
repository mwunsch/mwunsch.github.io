This Week's Program: May 1 - May 5
==================================

I made a lot of progress this week and hit a couple of big milestones
on this project. I also crashed a whole lot of processes.

## [ba751844ebdff7c8a0f35a2ad5b9cb9c498dd438][gobject-unref]

Whenever a GObject pointer is transformed into its Racket
representation from C, it is wrapped in a [deallocator][dealloc] so
that the resource is automatically released when it becomes
inaccessible. Notably in this commit, I pull in `libgobject` as
another FFI lib to utilize which will come into play more later.

## [5f1db6dbac49beddb9ff0d42406c7bcba3edd9f0][connect]

I define and expose the `connect` function, which is for wiring up a
GObject [Signal][signals]. Using `libgobject` that I required
previously, I create an FFI binding for
`g_signal_connect_data`. The `connect` Racket function takes a
GObject, a Signal name, and a Procedure and will cast the procedure to
a C function pointer (deriving its type from GObject
Introspection). There's a lot wrong with this initial implementation,
as I would soon find out later, but I was able to observe that I could
create a Racket `lambda` and see it called later when C emitted the
signal, which was exciting.

## [395d0d07ee77b2b5836c4e3bad57bbf1e59f18bc][playbin]

**I played a video using my Racket bindings to the GStreamer
library.** Major milestone accomplished! Using nothing but my own
`ffi/unsafe/introspection` library, I was able to get GStreamer
working enough to go
through [*Basic Tutorial 1: Hello World!*][tutorial1]. I played the
movie trailer for [*Thor: Ragnarok*][ragnarok].

What's more, because this is Racket, I could do that through my REPL
within Emacs. I call `(send pipeline set-state 'playing)` to start the
video and `(send pipeline set-state 'null)` to end it and close the
window. It just works. That was Monday.

The official GStreamer C tutorial has you playing a WebM file and I
couldn't get that to work. I fiddled with it a bit before just trying
a Mov. Later I would try running this playbin with that WebM file
through [gst-launch][gst-launch] and saw this error message:

> ERROR: from element
> /GstPlayBin:playbin0/GstURIDecodeBin:uridecodebin0: Your GStreamer
> installation is missing a plug-in.

When I installed the gstreamer plugins through Homebrew, I did not
build `gst-plugins-base` with libogg or libvorbis support. I haven't
tried to do that but I think that would fix this WebM problem. Moving
onâ€¦

## [d7ad2a7f4311d2aa79d9a31e1f183d27bf7cb8c2][g_object_get]

A major component of GStreamer's API is setting GObject properties on
Elements. That's how you configure an Element to do a thing. In the
previous tutorial, I set the `uri` property on the playbin Element
when constructing it. Because of GStreamer's plugin nature, GObject
Introspection does not know about all the available properties for a
particular Element instance.

Using `libgobject` again, I create bindings for two C functions used
for getting and setting GObject properties: `g_object_get` and
`g_object_set`. To make the names more idiomatic Racket, I call them
`gobject-get` and `gobject-set!`. Because I don't know the types
of the properties ahead of time, I have the user explicitly pass them
in. I use these to complete the next tutorial.

## [33f962af89bee594c30ac6d7045c122d66142d29][test-pattern]

[*Basic Tutorial 2: GStreamer concepts*][tutorial2] has us use the
`videotestsrc` to create a stream of a test video. You can set which
test pattern by setting a [property][videotestsrc-pattern] on the
source element. Within Racket, I can do this now with

    (gobject-set source 'pattern 'smpte _test-pattern)

Where `_test-pattern` is a C enum representing the different choices
of pattern.

I made a gif for you!

Later on, I expanded the tutorial by adding a [`vertigotv`][vertigotv]
filter. It looks like this:

## [85434b6b813aab59d478757e11aa0255dd62806c][callback]

After my great success with Tutorial 2, I began work on [Basic Tutorial
3: Dynamic pipelines][tutorial3]. This tutorial has you connecting a
signal to an element and doing something to that element within the
callback so that the video (or in this case, audio) can complete
passing through the pipeline.

I crashed my process. Over and over and over and over
again.

> Segmentation fault: 11

I couldn't figure out why; I was at a total loss. I was able, through
continuously bashing my keyboard and the process of elimination, learn
that the source of this fault was in my signal handler. I tried a few
different things, like making sure my callback was retained in memory
properly. A segfault is typically unearthed when you try to access
some memory that isn't there or is NULL.

Finally, I opened up the macOS Console application (which got a nice
little upgrade in Sierra). Diagnostic Reports for program crashes are
stored in `~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports` and from there I could
pull up the stacktrace of my Racket program.

width="100%" alt="The Diagnostic Report of my crashed Racket process"
/>

From here, it says that the Crashed Thread was number 13. Scrolling downâ€¦

<img src="http://www.markwunsch.com/img/overscan-crashed-thread.png"
width="100%" alt="The stack trace of the crashed thread of my Racket
process" />

Here is the stack trace of the crashed thread. I can see here, that
the `g_element_add_pad` is called in C, as I would expect it to. This
in turn causes a `g_signal_emit` call. This continues up into the FFI
calls from `libffi` then up into Racket and then â€” crash. At
`ffi_do_callback`. So it's able to get just up to the point of calling
my procedure and then *poof* there's nothing there.

After some googling I come
across
[this thread](https://lists.racket-lang.org/users/archive/2010-July/040409.html) on
the Racket mailing list from 2010.

Back to this commit! For my Signal handler callback, when determining
the C representation of the handler, I add the `#:async-apply`
keyword. With this keyword, my Racket procedure handler can be used in
a foreign thread. Because GStreamer is heavily threaded, this little
mechanism allows GStreamer's threads to await my Racket process when
the signal callback is being applied. This is some seriously unsafe
stuff (in the memory sense), as the callback is limited to what kinds
of things it can do. While I'm in this code, I also make a little
update to make sure that my Signal handling is correct: the first
argument to a signal callback is always the instance it's connected to
and the last argument to the callback is arbitrary user-supplied
data.

## [838471bf94c020d128c281a672c19a2514a09c96][uridecodebin]

Now I can complete the third tutorial. In this tutorial, I download
the Thor movie trailer, but this time I open up the container when it
is available and just get the audio portion. And I hear Jeff
Goldblum's sweet melodious voice. And life is good.

The commits I made today allow me to better infer types for the user
data passed into the callback function.

I'm really proud of what I was able to accomplish this week. All of
this low-level C stuff just to be able to use GStreamer in a way that
feels natural in Racket. I'm able to do this without using the
functions from `ffi/unsafe` at all â€” I'm only interacting with the API
provided by my GObject Introspection library. So far, it's working
brilliantly.

So far this only has been working from within the Emacs REPL. Here, I
can call the functions to play, pause, and stop with ease. DrRacket
crashes when I try this. When I try to run this from the command line
with `racket`, it just hangs forever. I think this is because
everything is confined to the main thread, and when I block the main
thread to await the audio to complete, I'm also blocking my Signal
callback from being invoked. I need to start introducing threading to
this program.

But for now I'll just keep listening to Jeff Goldblum.
