This Week's Program: Aug 22 - Aug 26
====================================

This week, I celebrated my birthday. Another year living under the
ongoing threat of chemtrails. jk.

I'm not emailing this from my FreeBSD server. I'll let you know when
that happens.

This week was all about getting familiar with how to do things in
**Elm**. I spent the bulk of my work pouring over documentation and
Elm package source code.

This is the SVG clock example right from the
[*Elm Introduction*](http://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/effects/time.html). Since
I first encountered Elm, the language has evolved and the terminology
I had
[originally associated](http://elm-lang.org/blog/farewell-to-frp) with
the language has been refined. As I worked through this example, I
couldn't help but think, "what is happening under the hood?"
Particularly as I work to understand Elm's
[Effects Managers](http://guide.elm-lang.org/effect_managers/) â€” the
things that are actually driving the `Sub` and `Cmd` types down to the
host. Elm is a language that is actively being developed, so a lot of
these concepts haven't quite been pinned down, and documentation is
catching up.

There is an explosion of tools in the JavaScript build tool space:
[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com), [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com),
[Broccoli](http://broccolijs.com), [Brunch](http://brunch.io)â€¦ I just
like that old standby [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/). You
tell a **Makefile** what you want to make, how to make it, and what
you need to make it, in a quirky, terse syntax, and it does that. It's
been doing this reasonably well since the 1970's. Comfort in working
with a **Makefile** separates the 10x developers from the 10x
chumps. It's one of those tools, like **AWK**, that you won't regret
having learned. Sure maybe it's not for every thing, but it'll do darn
well for most things.

Anyway, I start a Makefile for quickly building this project to JS
without having to be super specific with `elm make` every time.

Most Elm projects reach for the really nice
[`elm reactor`](https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-reactor), but I always
feel like it's much easier to start in rapid loops on the
terminal. The `elm repl` does a decent job, but it seems to be missing
a few things that would make it a great experimentation target. I want
my Elm program to spit stuff out to the command lineâ€¦

It turns out that's not something that Elm really does naturally.

## [eb46b177580c10b03ec707b37d08d01475c035c6][port]

Elm is less of a general purpose programming language and more of a
robust DSL for making web apps. The
[interop story](http://guide.elm-lang.org/interop/javascript.html)
with JavaScript is prescriptive, and puts its burden on the
implementor. You set up your Elm application to expose certain
functions with `port` to act as a *"hole in the side of your Elm
program where you can plug stuff in."* With either `Sub` or `Cmd` you
can either subscribe to Elm messages from JavaScript, or send
JavaScript messages into Elm. There's really not much else you can
do. If you want tighter integration with the host environment that's
just not very well documented, and is kind of actively discouraged by
Elm's community. The idea is that you don't want to so readily escape
Elm's purity, but there's still a lot of missing functionality in
Elm's packages. All Elm `main` functions must have a type of
[`Program`](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/4.0.5/Platform#Program),
but so far that type can only be constructed through Elm's
[`Html.App`](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/html/1.1.0/Html-App).

For my Elm app to interact with a command line process is going to be
tricky. Luckily, I know how to rock a rhyme that's right on time.

## [8f8e20bd9b970c75e626ae953cf3b230d724cc6c][leftpad]

Here's a little node app that pulls in the compiled Elm project. It
sets up the Elm application as a `worker`, which is a way of
initializing the Elm `Program` without a DOM tree. It subscribes to
the `tick` function from Elm and outputs a clock, centered in the
terminal window. The clock is driven by Elm.

Next week I hope to write some *Necromunda*-specific types and models
for the game, as I read through a big selection of texts:

+ Browsing <https://github.com/isRuslan/awesome-elm>
+ [Elm Tutorial](https://www.gitbook.com/book/sporto/elm-tutorial/details)
+ Pestering the [Elm Slack](http://elmlang.herokuapp.com)
+ [Elm Effect Managers](https://medium.com/@alex.lew/8e87fd14332c#.n5orw7dk7)
+ Robert Nystrom's [Game Programming Patterns](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com)
+ And a whole lot of videos to watch

Until then,<br />
