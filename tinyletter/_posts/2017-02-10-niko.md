This Week's Program: Feb 6 - Feb 10
===================================

This week was a pretty slow one in terms of commits, but I spent quite
a bit of time familiarizing myself
with [**Racket**](http://racket-lang.org). Racket is the next language
on my list to learn and where I'm going to be attempting my next
project.

My commits this week were mostly around the smooth transition from my
work-issued laptop to my FreeBSD server. I want to be able to work in
either without feeling a noticeable mismatch in capabilities. I'm
continuing to refine my server's configuration
in [`mechwarper`](https://github.com/mwunsch/mechwarper). This week I
tweaked my [tmux][tmux] configuration, made sure [aspell][aspell] was
installed on my server, and fuddled with my emacs [color-theme][theme]
when in a terminal.

## Why Racket?

My first experiences with "real" functional programming, insofar as I
was working with a programming language that emphasized its own
functional-ness, was with **Scala**. I had *known of* Lisp. I had a
sense of its influence on other languages; [Ruby][acceptable] in
particular, since that's what I was closest to. I knew there was a
relationship between Lisp and Scheme and a [debate][lisp1] between
Lisp<sub>1</sub> or Lisp<sub>2</sub> and
that [Lisp was not an acceptable Lisp][not-acceptable]. I knew people
made jokes about [parentheses](https://xkcd.com/297/). I
knew [SICP][sicp] was *the* most important programming book and that I
was embarrassed to admit that I had only given it a cursory glance.

Some folks haven't seen *Star Wars* but they know it inhabits their
consciousness. They know about Jedis and the ancestry of Luke
Skywalker and they know that the force is with them. *Star Wars* has
had a profound impact on every movie post-Star Wars. You can't watch a
movie and not see threads of Star Wars, even if you've never watched
Star Wars. My relationship to Lisp was like the people who haven't
seen Star Wars. We know its there, we can recognize its notes and its
themes and its influence on everything else, but we haven't
experienced it firsthand. I suspect many developers have similar
sentiments about Lisp.

When I was immersed in Scala and its type systems I thought I had a
good understanding of functional programming. That was until I was
given the book [_The Little Schemer_][little-schemer]. *The Little
Schemer* is my favorite programming book. I think every developer
should take the time to read it. It's short, it's written in a
friendly tone, and I learned a ton from reading it. It was that book
that pushed me over the edge to learn **Clojure** and **Emacs Lisp**
and now **Racket**.

I first encountered Racket under the
name [PLT Scheme](http://racket-lang.org/new-name.html). There are a
lot of [Schemes](http://www.schemers.org):

+ [Chez](http://www.scheme.com)
+ [Gambit](http://dynamo.iro.umontreal.ca/wiki/index.php/Main_Page)
+ [Chicken](http://www.call-cc.org)
+ [Guile](https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/)

All are interesting to me. It's been suggested to me that Racket is
not the best place to start with Scheme, and to consider some of these
other implementations.

I'm choosing Racket for a few reasons:

1. Matthew Butterick's
   excellent [*Practical Typography*](http://practicaltypography.com)
   is written in [Pollen](http://docs.racket-lang.org/pollen/), a
   publishing system of his own design, created with
   Racket. His
   [writing](http://practicaltypography.com/why-racket-why-lisp.html)
   and [speaking](https://youtu.be/IMz09jYOgoc) on why he chose Racket
   has influenced me more than anything else. I intend to read
   his [Beautiful Racket](http://beautifulracket.com) over the course
   of the next week. This dude made an incredibly beautiful book in a
   publishing system of his own creation and wrote in stunningly clear
   terms why Racket enabled him to do that. Awesome.
2. [The Racket Manifesto](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/manifesto/) is
   the kind of document I wish existed for more programming languages.
3. The [*Learning Racket*](https://artyom.me/learning-racket-1) blog
   post series about one Haskell developer's immersion in Racket.
4. [Rosette](https://emina.github.io/rosette/),
   [PLT Redex](https://redex.racket-lang.org),
   [Datalog](https://docs.racket-lang.org/datalog/index.html?q=datalog),
   [Typed Racket](https://docs.racket-lang.org/ts-guide/index.html?q=typed%20racket) —
   All interesting systems in their own right. Racket unlocks all of
   these interesting modes of programming.
5. This past year I attended a
   fun [Papers We Love](http://paperswelove.org/chapter/newyork/)
   meetup where [David Nolen](http://swannodette.github.io)
   presented
   [*Parsing with Derivatives*](http://matt.might.net/papers/might2011derivatives.pdf) with
   one of the authors, Matt Might, in attendance. The paper is a big
   influence on [`clojure.spec`](https://clojure.org/about/spec). The
   paper presents its work implemented in Racket. At the meetup when
   asked "Why Racket?" Matt said "because it's the best." I'm sold!

My goal for the next couple of weeks is to get myself familiar with
the language, the ecosystem, the community, and the idioms. I've found
there is nothing more challenging in learning a new language then
understanding how projects tend to be structured and learning the
community mores.
