This Week's Program: July 11 - July 15
======================================

I am a veritable
[_Thundurus_](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Thundurus_(Pokémon))
this week. Because of my prowess with Cloud computing. I don't know
it's a Pokémon I guess.

## [49b9b22164c3927d93c6947e7b75f9ebd6cdf592][deploy-agent]

In my CloudFormation template I add instructions to install the
[AWS CodeDeploy Agent](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/host-cleanup.html). This
is used to get code from CodeDeploy onto an instance.

## [41c49c64a8de9716521d339b8c3b1e0e6988760c][deploymentgroup]

I build up a
[Deployment Group](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/deployment-groups.html)
and choose a recent revision of `sonic-sketches` to deploy onto a
machine.

## [cda4f095269f62dd4cfd6bf8bd7f11e644a9eed1][appspec]

I bring back the CodeDeploy
[Appspec](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/app-spec-ref.html)
file, and begin a series of commits where I tweak the parameters and
permissions of this file.

At this point, I'm bringing up CloudFormation stacks and tearing them
down, each time tweaking the Appspec file. I can get my code onto the
box. Each revision of the Appspec brings me closer to running the
code. This is Monday.

## [81b35621e118735468e5c68f745889692e88684f][beforeinstall]

It's Tuesday. I'm adding a
[hook](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/app-spec-ref-hooks.html)
for the CodeDeploy BeforeInstall event. Later, I would change this to
_AfterInstall_ and continue to tweak it.

## [8aa61334e3a437619349462bcece36f32d1d0c8f][revisionsha]

I parameterize the GitHub revision commit to be deployed on initial
stack creation.

Eventually, I am able to reliably use CodeDeploy to ensure that the
`sonic-sketches` program is in place on the filesystem after stack
creation. I am able to run `sonic-sketches` successfully.

Now to automate it further.

## [bb6087d68c924553293608c1981bb457665828fd][jackd-dummy]

I parameterize the GitHub repository that houses `sonic-sketches`. Of
course the default is mine, but if anybody wants to fork the repo and
this cloud-formation template, they should be able to see similar
success.

I also have have my `nohup` jackd script run during
provisioning. After a typo fix I can just log-in to the box once the
CloudFormation stack has been created and run `lein trampoline run` in
my `sonic-sketches` directory and a song pops in to S3.

## [92f5af7aacac114e634e635b189fa7abd9875532][deploying-user]

I create a new IAM User with access keys for the purposes of deploying
through CodeDeploy. At this point, I'm just following along with this
tutorial published by Amazon:
[_Automatically Deploy from GitHub Using AWS CodeDeploy_](http://blogs.aws.amazon.com/application-management/post/Tx33XKAKURCCW83/Automatically-Deploy-from-GitHub-Using-AWS-CodeDeploy). Using
the
[GitHub Auto-Deployment](https://atmos.org/github-services/auto-deployment/)
webhook/service works like a charm. When I push to GitHub, it is
automatically deployed to my EC2 instance. This is Wednesday.

Then I get a wacky idea in my head.

## [576f7a8e2a0fe8ff57ddd85fa577511256cf82c8][stackid]

I change the CodeDeploy tag filter to use the CloudFormation stack
ID. This is what CodeDeploy uses to determine what instances to deploy
to. By using the Stack ID tag, I can be sure that CodeDeploy only
deploys to the instances within its CloudFormation stack.

I spend some time Thursday and today on this next commit.

## [ab8d28b078e5e3ef5c658abfe0a1c1ba2972a09d][customhook]

When I pull up the CloudFormation stack for `sonic-sketches` I want to
automatically create the AWS CodeDeploy webhook on the Git
repository. This takes some doing.

First, I create a
[Custom Resource](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-custom-resources.html)
in CloudFormation. This resource represents the GitHub webhook. The
Custom Resource is backed by an
[AWS Lambda](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-custom-resources-lambda.html)
function. This function uses the Node runtime in Lambda and uses the
[`cfn-response` module](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-lambda-function-code.html)
to respond to the CloudFormation custom resource: this module tells
CloudFormation whether or not that custom resource was able to be
created.

Within the template I type out the Lambda function code. After a bunch
of trial and error, I put my finished Lambda fn in a
[gist](https://gist.github.com/mwunsch/c4e18040cbca7ef493e3290f69886dfd). This
was my first time _really_ using
[_ECMAScript® 2015_](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/)
in anger and my first time _really_ using NodeJS in several
years. Here's how this function works:

+ The Custom Resource in CloudFormation calls this Lambda function and
  says "Hey, I've got a Custom Resource here. Can you make this for
  me?"
+ This Lambda function pulls out a bunch of properties I've explicitly
  passed to the Custom Resource, like a GitHub
  [personal access token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/)
  with the `admin:repo_hook` scope, the CodeDeploy Application name
  and Deployment Group, and the IAM User keys.
+ Using these properties, the function makes a POST request to the
  GitHub API to
  [create a webhook](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/hooks/#create-a-hook),
  specifying that this is for the CodeDeploy service. (I find making
  a straightforward HTTP request in Node cumbersome).
+ If the webhook is successfully created, CloudFormation is signaled
  that this Custom Resource creation was a success. Otherwise, it
  signals a failure.

I also build another IAM Role so that this Lambda function can write
logs to CloudWatch.

After a bunch of trial and error, and watching the CloudWatch logs
like a hawk, I can now successfully create a GitHub repository webhook
for my CodeDeploy service as a resource within my CloudFormation
stack.

Theoretically, this Lambda function should also be triggered when it's
time to delete this resource, but I found in my experiments that this
branch of code was never called.

So now that I've overengineered the hell out of this I feel quite good
about the results. This was my first exposure doing something with
Lambda and it is awesome. I have now automated the deploy of my code
to my AWS stack whenever I `git push`.

Next week, I need to make some changes to the application to support
some of these new stack ideas. I also intend on setting up a scheduled
job to generate a song at regular intervals.

CloudFormation, I choose you!<br />
