This Week's Program: Nov 23 - Nov 27
====================================

Happy Thanksgiving! Going to keep it brief, because it's Black Friday
and oh those deals. Not going to show any commits. Bit of a
breakthrough week. Feels like I've gotten a grasp of some of the
fundamental principles of these systems. Mostly, the relationship
between Leiningen, nREPL, and CIDER. I feel like I'm getting a real
grasp of getting feedback and being productive in Clojure.

So this week I'm thankful for these folks (and some of their great talks):

+ [Rich Hickey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhkdyCPYgLs), the
  author of Clojure.
+ [Sam Aaron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imoWGsipe4k), a
  contributor to Overtone, and the creator of
  [Sonic Pi](http://sonic-pi.net/). This talk of his is something I've
  been watching on repeat. It's really good.
+ [David Nolen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDZpSIngwm4), a
  prolific developer in the Clojure community and the creator of
  [Om](https://github.com/omcljs/om). This recent talk of his powers
  through a huge number of concepts that are hugely impressive and I'm
  so excited about the future of UI programming with David's thought
  leadership.

Next week will be great.
