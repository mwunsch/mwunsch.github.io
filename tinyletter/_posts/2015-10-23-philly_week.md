This Week's Program: Oct 19 - Oct 23
====================================

Greetings from Philadelphia! I'm here celebrating a momentous family
occasion. This is my first time testing the waters of keeping the
[streak][streak] going whilst traveling. It's been a pretty low-key
week for code, and that's fine! I count blogging as coding for the
purposes of the streak. I write my blog posts in Markdown in Emacs so
it at least *looks* like I'm writing code. That should count! Also,
when I'm not *feeling* programming it's nice to escape into prose,
where only jerks yell about my syntax and I can get away with not
writing tests.

Some **SCSS** and [Liquid][liquid] markup to support displaying tags
in my tumblelog post.

When you write code, stuff like this can be thrilling. Publishing post
tags to Tumblr through POSSE is a one-line addition. ðŸ’¥

## mwunsch.github.io: [a5dcc66b4a9ecde6151f340d3bf1a46e8e340d17][emacs-blog-post]

I published a [blog post][blog-link] about my migration to Emacs.

This week I also Open Sourced a small project I built at my
[job][rtr]. [**Flaggrocrag**][flaggrocrag] is a *git-aware* feature
flagging system. We've had a lot of problems with our
[Feature Toggle][toggles] system. In our last hack week, I took a few
days to sketch out Flaggrocrag. I think my approach is pretty
clever. Basically, I use GitHub Flavored Markdown documents and parse
feature flags out from a Git Blame. A git repository is a handy little
graph database, you know. The project is in RFC-mode internally, but I
figured why not release this to the world. The Apache license is just
fine but I'm Not a Lawyer.

Hey let me know what you think about all this code and this
TinyLetter.

TTFN<br />- Mark
