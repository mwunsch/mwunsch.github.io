This Week's Program: May 21 - May 25
====================================

Well, hello. It's been a long while. Just over a quarter! I've been
very busy! Here's the executive summary:

+ Back in February, I started a new job! I'm now the **VP of
  Engineering at [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/)**!! I've
  been _loving_ my job. This past week I officially hit the three
  month mark. Kickstarter is a company with a mission that is urgent
  and necessary. It is a [Public Benefit
  Corporation](https://www.kickstarter.com/charter), a very cool
  governance model that I will one day write way more about. I am so
  thrilled to be heading up the engineering team here.
+ As you can imagine, I've been quite busy figuring out just what the
  heck I ought to be doing in my new job. But I'm still writing little
  bits of code daily. I'm still working on
  [Overscan](https://www.markwunsch.com/overscan/)!
+ This Tinyletter has been very quiet, _but_ you can read more of my
  updates over on Drip: [d.rip/mark](https://d.rip/mark)!
  [Drip](https://d.rip/) is a new tool for creators made by
  Kickstarter! It is still in early beta, and I get to be a guinea pig
  for the product. You can subscribe to my Drip for $0 (no money), and
  get all my updates on both the web and, yes, by email! I'm really
  excited by how this product is taking shape, and you _know_ I'm
  going to figure out how to make updates to it through Emacs.

So that's whats been happening. I would really love for you to
subscribe to my Drip. It's likely I won't be making frequent updates
to this Tinyletter (which, uh, shouldn't be too much of a surprise).

Since joining Kickstarter, one of the big projects I've been at the
helm at is compliance with [GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/), which I will
at some point write a very large amount of words about. A couple of
weeks ago I gave my first ever live demo of Overscan at
[!!con](http://bangbangcon.com/), and that went really well. I built
my slides in
[Racket](https://docs.racket-lang.org/slideshow/index.html), and you
can view the code for the slides and the demos
[here](https://gist.github.com/mwunsch/01f52fc8a3377c7016395db3e630e3e0).

When I first started this Tinyletter, it was meant to be a forcing
function to ensure that I was writing code and articulating my
decisions. It's been such a nice bonus that I've built this audience
of supportive, thoughtful, and encouraging readers. I really
appreciate you reading along each week, and I hope you'll continue to
join me across the Internet. I have so much I've been bursting to say
in the last few months, and I so appreciate your gift of time and
attention.

Talk later,<br />
