This Week's Program: Apr 24 - Apr 28
====================================

I couldn't come up with a catchy subject line this week. I was too
busy _jamming_ on this code.

## [cabda551d376937c1a3a97396dbb6f6e1570b987][require]

"Let's make a macro!" it says in the commit message. Once again, I dip
into the [`define-syntax`][transformers] well. This time, I think to
myself, I will finally find an appropriate application of macros.

The `gir/require` macro takes a namespace symbol and a list of
symbols, looks up those symbols with GObject Introspection, and binds
identifiers to those values. e.g.

    (gir/require 'Gst (init_check version_string ElementFactory))

Would create the identifiers `init-check`, `version-string`, and
`element-factory` and bind them to the respective forms from the C
GStreamer library.

## [678f2353386360eeb401d2e2aaf34511544a5790][gstreamer-main]

I create `gstreamer/main.rkt`. I also `provide` a bunch of bindings
from my introspection library. Using the bindings that I got with
`gir/require` I initialize GStreamer and print out its version.

When I `provide` bindings out of the `introspection` library I attach
Racket [contracts](https://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/contracts.html)
to them. From the Racket Guide:

> Like a contract between two business partners, a software contract
> is an agreement between two parties. The agreement specifies
> obligations and guarantees for each “product” (or value) that is
> handed from one party to the other.
>
> A contract thus establishes a boundary between the two
> parties. Whenever a value crosses this boundary, the contract
> monitoring system performs contract checks, making sure the partners
> abide by the established contract.

Contracts are a whole thing, and I had first heard of Design By
Contract™ (yeah it's really trademarked) when reading about
the [**Eiffel**](https://www.eiffel.com/values/design-by-contract/)
programming language. Eiffel will tell you it's about eliminating
bugs, which is great and also not true. The value that Contracts
provide is a form of documentation.

The contract for the `introspection` function says:

    (->* (symbol?) (string?) gi-repository?)

You can read this like: The `introspection` function accepts a Symbol
and an optional String and will return a GI-Repository.

In my REPL I can not do this and get a helpful message when I violate
the contract:

    > (introspection "Gst" 7)
    ; introspection: contract violation
    ;   expected: symbol?
    ;   given: "Gst"
    ;   in: the 1st argument of
    ;       (->* (symbol?) (string?) gi-repository?)
    ;   contract from:
    ;       <pkgs>/overscan/ffi/unsafe/introspection.rkt
    ;   blaming: <pkgs>/overscan/gstreamer/main.rkt
    ;    (assuming the contract is correct)
    ;   at: <pkgs>/overscan/ffi/unsafe/introspection.rkt:39.24

A contract can tell you what you're doing wrong when calling a
function and what that function's expectations are. This is useful if,
like me, you prefer to bash your code with your keyboard over and over
again until it works.

## [93c6294c1ac493b52b4eaa4ad4e717e657cc604a][remove-macro]

I don't want to say "all macros are dumb" but this one is dumb so I
remove it. It just doesn't provide that much value over the
procedures. I learned a lot about writing macros in the
process. Something about it being the journey and not the destination
or whatever. Get outta here `gir/require`.

## [9dc4b8f4ee3c31bb4ecde770362757f602960281][remove-class]

And while we're at it, I'll remove last week's `eval` call to create a
class. Within the context of the GStreamer module, this didn't
work. There's a thing about eval and namespaces that I just don't
quite feel like learning about, and this is some extraneous code
anyway. Instead of using `racket/class`, I'll create an API for
GObjects that matches `racket/class` conventions.

Now, instead of creating a class with quasiquotes and instantiating
that when I get a pointer from C, I'll just put that pointer into a
new struct called `gobject` that inherits from `gtype-instance`. Then,
I create a bunch of functions like those from the `racket/class`
library, like `dynamic-send`, `dynamic-get-field`, and
`dynamic-set-field!`.

## [332c982140e8021b6faaf2026ed1aa7b56a8e585][macros-r-back]

Now is the time to bring back macros and this time they stick around!
The `send` macro, like its dual from `racket/class`, is a macro for
invoking a method on an object. It just calls to `dynamic-send`, but I
want to give the user here a real OOP experience.

In another commit I write `get-field`, `set-field!`, and
`field-bound?` to round out the API compatibility with
`racket/class`. Finally, I learned how to use a damn macro.

## [ee71c2689aa15f2a2db1acef1d7867d7756a2e63][macro-contract]

I can even create a contract on one of the forms passed into a macro!
This contract states that when using the `send` macro, the first
expression (named the "receiver") has to be a `gobject`. Let's break
it:

    > (send 'foobar baz)
    ; receiver of send: broke its own contract
    ;   promised: gobject?
    ;   produced: 'foobar
    ;   in: gobject?
    ;   contract from:
    ;       <pkgs>/overscan/gstreamer/main.rkt
    ;   blaming: <pkgs>/overscan/gstreamer/main.rkt
    ;    (assuming the contract is correct)
    ;   at: stdin::7059-7066

When writing macros in Racket, [`syntax/parse`][syntax-parse] am
pretty cool.

## [928148c996fb22f5f8f6be76f5380ea0ed5a4bcb][lookup-method]

This code creates inheritance in the style of Smalltalk. When I lookup
a method, I try to find it on the GObject's class, and if that fails,
I try again on that class's
parent. [Tail-call optimization][tail-recursion], you're the best.

[tail-recursion]: https://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/Lists__Iteration__and_Recursion.html#%28part._tail-recursion%29

## [5c788a69ba2ea6e9a5e1e2aafdadbc62a5c63c68][responds-to]

Another macro! Something that I missed from `racket/class` was
something like Ruby's
`respond_to?`. Let's
[duck type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing) the heck out of
some objects. I want to give myself tools and functionality so that
within the context of a REPL I can learn as much as I can about the
GObjects I get back from C. Bashing it with my keyboard. Functions
like this new `responds-to?` macro and Contracts give me these
training wheels.

## [f2dadfbe1b0b325e941dd2e7b08cc25b5461020a][constructor-cast]

Finally, I do something that I'm not 100% certain about. When I call a
method on a `gi-object` (which my brain just substitutes for the word
"class"), I look to see if that function is flagged as a
constructor. If it is, I cast the returned object to this class. This
is something that I'm doing just based on the experience I'm having
with GStreamer.

For example, in my `gstreamer/main.rkt`, I call `(pipeline 'new
"my-pipeline")`. I would think this would have returned me a
`GstPipeline` instance, but Pipeline inherits from Element and the
`new` function returns an Element. By doing the `cast` this way, I can
ensure that I get back an instance of an object that I've called a
`constructor` on. I might regret this decision, but so far based on
my limited exposure to these C libraries, this feels like the right
thing to do.

Now I can go through the [GStreamer documentation][gstreamer-docs] and
follow along.

    > (pipeline-add-many my-pipeline source filter sink)
    #t
    > (send source link filter)
    #t
    > (send filter link sink)
    #t

Now I've got myself a Gst pipeline that doesn't do anything! I need to
keep reading the documentation…
