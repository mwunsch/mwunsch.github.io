This Week's Program: June 20 - June 24
======================================

After last week's [joyous celebration][last-week], this week feels
like a clunker. For the first time since beginning I unwillingly broke
my code streak. Previous breaks were conscious decisions. This week
was harried and sloppy. It's frustrating. I have to fight back an
immature urge to throw my hands up in the air and say "This is all
fucked" and use this slip as an excuse to abandon the entire
practice. That would be my tendency. A deliberate, repetitive practice
like this is designed to overwrite the typical tendencies of the
practitioner. Therefore it's important that _when_ the practice slips
not to fall into the all too familiar and comfortable habit of
avoiding the work.

The coding practice has, if anything, reinforced other parts of my
life. When I feel like a failure and I want to throw my hands up and
admit defeat and say "This is all fucked" and go back to a comfortable
sedentary existence it's important to reflect on the practice. Making
a deliberate habit of writing code has taught me to make a deliberate
habit of living. Accepting the breaks, carrying on, taking each day as
a new opportunity to improve. Some weeks are shit. That's no excuse
not to keep shipping.

That got heavy for a weekly coding newsletter.

I'm not going to link commits today. The code I wrote wasn't all that
intersting. Mostly I'm just reading a little bit of the CloudFormation
docs each day. Each day I learn a little bit more and add some fields
to the JSON template. I removed the Packer and `appspec.yml`
templates, and am devoting all of my energies to CloudFormation,
learning a ton about AWS in the process.

Thank you for subscribing. I appreciate that you dedicate a chunk of
your inbox and your attention to my practice.
