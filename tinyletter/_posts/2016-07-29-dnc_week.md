This Week's Program: July 25 - July 29
======================================

There's a lot to be both excited and anxious about this week. For
those feeling overwhelmed with emotion, my advice is to do what I do:
don't feel. Write code.

Here's the code that I wrote while suppressing the urge to write a
think piece on Facebook…

## [d8c28f84a32c83041e4167d5ea4358ea9f616079][crontab]

[`cron`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) is a fun and infuriating
piece of software. Here's what I want to do: Every day at 9am NYC time
the program should run and make a song. Inside of my CloudFormation
template I do the JSON plate spinning required to ensure that my
[crontab](http://crontab.org) is loaded onto the system and that it
pulls the correct variables out of the stack. Here's what it looks
like:

    FORECAST_API_KEY={KEY}
    0 13 * * *  cd /srv/sonic_sketches &&
    ↪ /usr/local/bin/lein trampoline run {BUCKET} >/dev/null 2>&1

I'll break this down: At the top, you can set environment settings
that will be passed as variables into the running script. I do this
for my Forecast API credentials that last week I passed as a
CloudFormation parameter.

`0 13 * * *` is the
[crontab scheduling syntax](http://crontab.guru). This says "run at
13:00 every day." The server's time zone is set to [UTC][utc]. NYC,
currently in Daylight Savings, is in the [EDT][edt] time zone, -0400
away from UTC.

I use `cd` and not `pushd` and the full path to lein, because the cron
job is run in a very limited shell environment. No `bash` here. That's
why I also use the full syntax to explicitly map standard error to
standard out (`2>&1`) versus the handy bash shorthand.

## [6b5a9f0f35c73a6ee7a606f272f76cfdd3d3ca84][new_york]

I want to always run the program at 9:00 am in NYC, and not have to
worry about Daylight Savings. To do that I set up two cron jobs: one
for 13:00 and one for 14:00. I write a
[test](http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/tests.html) with the
[`date`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/date.1.html)
command. `date +%z` outputs just the time zone offset from UTC. The
`date` command reads the `TZ` environment variable for time zone
information. Depending on if this is "-0400" or "-0500" the cronjob
will continue to execute the rest of the program.

Later I have to futz with this because crontabs are very sensitive to
the percent symbol (%) and because I execute date within a subshell,
the TZ var is not exported to it. This is resolved by
[87c5b32fba062506b268296d1df39a32d900a895][escape-percent].

## [44d1a2da067e56e0760eb2a0b1d536bdfdf7a73e][iso8601]

I reach into the bag of Java 8 tricks to do some better
[DateTime](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/jf14-date-time-2125367.html)
handling. With this, I grab the day of week _and_ the
[ISO8601](http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/iso8601.htm)
representation of the date. This is to make the filename in s3 easier
to understand.

## [c11a66e11a81ce8af3c1eb80559922d2e5001956][ignore-profiles]

I update `.gitignore` to ignore a local
[Leiningen profile](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/master/doc/PROFILES.md). I'm
going to put secrets here.

## [232ff32fd206253b756477b2b74b61f037422256][twitter4j]

The secrets I will put there are OAuth tokens for Twitter.

I bring in [Twitter4J](http://twitter4j.org/en/index.html), the Java
client for the [Twitter API](https://dev.twitter.com).

Next week, I'm going to automatically publish generated songs to
Twitter.
