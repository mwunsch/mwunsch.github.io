This Week's Program: Sep 5 - Sep 9
==================================

Greetings, from sunny (!) Portland, OR. I am here with my wonderful
partner [Vera](https://www.twitter.com/verathegrouch) for
the [XOXO Festival](https://xoxofest.com/2016). It's a celebration of
the creative impulse in introverts, and I'm proud to rep my little
tinyletter here as an example of something I'm proud of!

If you're here at the conference say "hi!"

I'm not going to do my usual commit run-down. Because, for one, my
attention is pulled in all sorts of different directions and getting
all the links together is tedious, and b, this hasn't been the most
eventful week.

Mostly I've set up a new module
in
[`hive-city`](https://github.com/mwunsch/hive-city),
[`Tabletop.elm`](https://github.com/mwunsch/hive-city/blob/master/src/Tabletop.elm). This
module is meant to house functions related to the game board,
providing measurement and movement types.

Adjusting to my new FreeBSD server setup has been enjoyable, but one
thing I've noticed is how it affects my contribution graph on
GitHub. Some commits are counting for different days on the
graph. That's because my server is set to UTC time, and
GitHub
[takes time zone into account](https://github.com/blog/1793-timezone-aware-contribution-graphs). Not
sure the best way of addressing this. Not super concerned though.

Okay, back to the conference. Full report next week!

â€“ Mark
