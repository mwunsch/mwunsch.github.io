This Week's Program: Dec 5 - Dec 9
==================================

I just realized that last week I got Friday's date wrong in my
tinyletter. Oops.

Tonight at 21:00 UTC-5:00 is when
the [Ludum Dare 37](https://ldjam.com)
begins. [Ludum Dare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludum_Dare) is
probably the most
well-known [_game jam_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_jam). Its
notoriety stems in large part from te
participation [Notch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markus_Persson),
the creator of Minecraft and "men's rights advocate" (see also:
_complete_ asshole). I have decided _not_ to participate in this Ludum
Dare. I think it requires a level of planning and commitment that I am
currently unable to deliver. I do intend to do it at some point, but I
hope to have some more experience under my belt and more tools at my
disposal. It feels like a bummer to bow out, but I know that if I
deluded myself up until the last minute into thinking I could actively
participate, it would have been a bigger bummer when reality
eventually set in. There's a lot to learn between now and when I would
feel competent enough to _jam_.

Not a lot of progress on `hive-city` this week. I took some time to
think critically about how I approached the code and began a little
refactoring. Vera, my amazing wife and frequent _This Week's Program_
presence, has been taking an intense, week-long Data Analytics course
at General Assembly. Data (either big
or [small](https://youtu.be/jw-3Ufd_u4c)) has never been a strong suit
of mine, and so I've spent time this week riding her coattails,
picking up some tricks in Excel and SQL. I'm so proud of her. She is a
self-determined, disciplined learner, and I'm more of a lazy
noodler. I've found that a lot of programmers look down their noses at
Excel, but it is an incredibly powerful tool. One highlight from my
second-hand data apprenticeship has been discovering and
using [`csvkit`](https://github.com/wireservice/csvkit). I'm still not
a strong data person, but knowing what is possible opens so many
doors.

## [b565ddd3b1168b7018361b24d3931404c9e3940d][tinyletter]

On Monday, I finally added
a [Tinyletter index](http://www.markwunsch.com/tinyletter/) to my
personal website. Look at all those words!

## [ab0efefbf4ab5e654aa7e8f58278f670c8d58b84][roll]

Back in `hive-city`. Last week I created the `Roll` Msg. This week, I
use that to execute all `Instructions`, even those that don't use
Dice.

## [a99174aed4ddb3336d36adc8979ffc7134f65022][game]

I also start my refactoring effort. Here, I'm slowly teasing out the
`GameState` concerns into a new module, `Game`.

The idea here is that there's a lot going on in the `Game`, but I want
to reserve my `Main` module for taking in user input and executing
updates to the Game state. There's also other stuff beyond the `Game`
â€” there's Gang creation, potentially a little tutorial thing, maybe
login stuffâ€¦ I think that the `Game` shouldn't be aware of mouse
clicks or keyboard actions, but just making sure that the game state
is advancing. This is also where I introduce having two players.

This is just the beginning, and I'm letting some of this code
emerge. If you look closely, you can see my enthusiasm for this
project waning.

## [8266bd89a3eb7ea22db16dba5df28ac82eb6d432][csv-mode]

I add [csv-mode](https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/csv-mode.html) to my
Emacs setup. I haven't used it yet, because all my data is _too big_.
