This Week's Program: Jan 16 - Jan 20
====================================

Today, I am distracting myself. I'll probably be distracting
myself for the next year or four. I've made some distractions for you,
too!

## [ed32b90981068b33d1ea8f69faf9ff4e9854ccfa][thinkpiece]

The major thing I did this week was
write [**my retrospective for Hive City**][retro]. This was my first
thing I've published to Medium, and I published it using the POSSE
mechanism on my Jekyll site. I write the post in Markdown, and a
Jekyll Generator publishes it to the Medium API.

[Please give it a read!][retro]

## [1fd8d60bb2cc89676ab41ab540ebccdf89bec21f][mechwarper]

Introducing [`mechwarper`](https://github.com/mwunsch/mechwarper)!
Mechwarper will be a repository for me to store my Ansible playbooks
I'll be writing out to manage my FreeBSD Digital Ocean server. In the
future I'll probably use this repository for all of my server
management playbooks, cookbooks, puppetbooks, dockerbooks,
whatever-kind-of-books.

## [e3450eae918653f7067bfc1f4abde880e12da9ee][flyspell]

I set up [FlySpell](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/FlySpell) in Emacs
to do spell checking in ERC and in Markdown documents. I always spell
definitely wrong. Now I definitely will not do that anymore.

Resist and fight how you best see fit,<br />
Mark
