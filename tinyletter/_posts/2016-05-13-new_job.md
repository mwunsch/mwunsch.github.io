This Week's Program: May 9 - May 13
===================================

It's my first week at [Harry's](https://www.harrys.com/) and my brain
feels like a very large glass of red wine that if tipped over would
stain the carpet so I've got to keep all this information delicately
balanced in my head. It's been a great week.

Most of my commits this week were focused on small tasks to tune my
development environment as I go from one computer to the next. Doing
this process always makes me want to automate this to hell and back:
provision a Mac to my liking. I don't think that's a valuable use of
my time, though.

Here's a quick list of the small changes:

## [4f12b44fd74a9550e5d8a41f724229de87aa90e9][works-for]

I changed my website to display my new employer.

## [9211cf070cd2261105754426d19a30888536f048][erc-nick]

I noticed that [ERC](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ERC) wasn't
picking up some of configuration and moved it into my main `init.el`.

I didn't read about
[ERC Startup Files](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ErcStartupFiles)
closely enough. Turns out the `.ercrc` file is read only after server
connection and MOTD.

## [232dad995d1f656f7893ad6c958d3e58b692f644][editorconfig]

The team at Harry's uses [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) to
enforce consistent code formatting throughout the team, so I installed
it's Emacs mode.

## [4c08c3943c026aaf3d15d7670d49adc341b72129][dirlocal]

Emacs also has a notion of
[Directory Local Variables](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Directory-Variables.html)
and those exist in the Harry's main repository as well. I configure
Emacs to mark certain variables as
["safe"](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Safe-File-Variables.html#Safe-File-Variables)
if they respond to a predicate.

## [e33aaeed9ad07d49682afe3f74a65b797417fe25][ensime]

Harry's also runs a tad bit of **Scala** in production. Rather than
spend more time than I'd like in an IDE (any time spent here is more
than I'd like), I figured I'd see how the Scala tooling for Emacs
is. I installed [ENSIME](http://ensime.github.io/) to see how much
mileage I could get out of it. Haven't really tested it out yet, but I
know I will soon enough. The last time I wrote Scala I was a Vim
user.

My talk at *!!con* was great fun and I'll be posting the video of that
whenever it's ready. You can check out
[my slides](https://speakerdeck.com/mwunsch/lol-im-so-random) in the
meantime.

Next week, I return to operationalizing `sonic-sketches`. Here's a
song for
[today](https://soundcloud.com/mwunsch/friday-3650294091063412458).
