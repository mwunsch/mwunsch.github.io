This Week's Program: June 27 - July 1
=====================================

After the unfortunate clunker of last week I received a handful of
very kind, encouraging emails. Thank you so much to those of you who
reached out. Thanks to all of you for your support and for the time
and attention you dedicate to my missives.

This week, I bounced back with aplomb and am pleased with my
progress. Over the weekend I had a breakthrough with my struggles over
cloud operations. The big mental hurdle I had to overcome was this:
_"It's easy to throw away virtual machines."_ Just put them in the
garbage. Cloud computers are cheap and disposable.

Time was when you got yourself a private server somewhere you just
hand-tuned that sucker to do everything you needed. Web server, mail
server, ftp serverâ€¦ one machine did all that stuff and restoring a
machine to a working state was an effort. The big revelation of cloud
computing and [_IaaS_][iaas] is that your servers are
[_cattle_][cattle]. Farmer wisdom says not to name livestock you plan
to slaughter. Morbid but folksy.

It took me a couple of times to get a feel for it, but terminating an
EC2 instance is easy and should be done frequently, with gusto. Once I
accepted that cloud computers are more akin to a
[paper boat](http://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Paper-Boat) than a Spanish
galleon, I became a lot less precious about my cloud.

## [651103066095ee08edff31e081cff22b13c62801][cfinit]

On Monday, things got off to a slow start as I get a better
understanding of
[`AWS::CloudFormation::Init`][cloudformation-init]. I'm feeling out
the entire EC2/AWS vocabulary.

## [33a93fcfc30fe6677edc758d5dee83f2c6c36c07][securitygroup]

Things get real. I'm actually running the `formation.json` template
through the Cloud Formation tool and attempting to shell into the EC2
instance. Turns out, I need to make sure the
[Security Group](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-network-security.html)
for the Instance allows network ingress access over TCP
[port 22](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers#Well-known_ports). So
I need to make sure that Cloud Formation knows how to create the
Security Group. In this commit I also expose Cloud Formation Outputs
so I know where on the Internet my EC2 instance lives.

I'm able to successfully SSH into my EC2 Instance. I destroy and
create the stack over and over again, drunk with power.

## [14f269f75a0e58df22f22aa67abe9348cc1ff78e][userdata]

I populate the `UserData` attribute of the EC2 instance. `UserData` is
used by EC2 to
[run commands on the instance at launch](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/user-data.html).

I use this to run through the same provisioning steps that I
previously was using for the Packer AMI.

This script is picked up by Ubuntu's
[`cloud-init`](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CloudInit), which is
a fascinating little tool. A short amount of time after the instance
is built, I can SSH into my EC2 Instance and run `which lein` and get
an answer.

In the commit message, I make a note about the next step.

## [f4d78fd029e089f7f79a5d0597b5d5d85baa8b2a][aws-cfn-bootstrap]

Here, I pull in the `python_setuptools` package so that I can
`easy_install` the
[AWS CloudFormation Helper scripts][cfn-helper-scripts]. These are
the scripts that work hand in hand with the
`AWS::CloudFormation::Init` metadata, but that's not why I'm pulling
them in.

## [18aa74311ad66b3f67f52db382f36f7b95008642][creationpolicy]

That provisioning step is really important. So important that if the
provisioning step fails, I want the entire stack creation to fail. To
do this in Cloud Formation, you use the
[`CreationPolicy`](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-attribute-creationpolicy.html)
attribute on a resource. You can then send a signal from the resource
(in this case my EC2 Instance) to tell Cloud Formation if the creation
of the resource was a success or a failure. In this commit, I've
stated that I expect that this EC2 resource will receive one signal
and the whole stack creation should fail if that signal isn't observed
within 5 minutes.

I use the [`cfn-signal`][cfn-signal] utility from the previously
installed helper scripts to send this signal as the last step of the
provisioning process. Because my provisioning script is executed with
`/bin/bash -e`, if there's an error anywhere in the script the entire
provisioning step should bail and this signal won't be sent.

A few more stack creations and destructions and I'm feeling pretty
good about the little machine in the clouds that will run
`sonic-sketches`.

Next week, I'll be focused on getting the `sonic-sketches` codebase
onto this machine so it can be run. I'll probably also be taking
Monday, July 4th, off. Hope y'all have a great holiday weekend.

Happy Canada Day, too, if that's your thing.
