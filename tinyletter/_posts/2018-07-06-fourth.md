This Week's Program: July 2 - July 6
====================================

It's been a week for countries in North America to commemorate events
in history! Hello friends!

Remember that I'm publishing more on Drip these days:
<https://d.rip/mark>

Just want to update you all on a few happenings in the world of
[Overscan](https://github.com/mwunsch/overscan)!

Firstly, you can now follow the project over on Twitter
[@overscan_lang](https://twitter.com/overscan_lang)!

Since my talk at [!!con][bangbangcon] ([the video of which is now
live!](https://youtu.be/2aOqaE6oByA)), I've been working on mostly
documentation.

Now, Overscan is available in the [Racket Package
Directory][racket-pkg]! And you can read the documentation on
[Racket's very own docs site][docs]!

I'm going to be winding down my work on Overscan in the next month or
so. I've been working on this particular project for over a year! Part
of that wind down is to make Overscan a better part of the Racket
ecosystem. So with a Racket installation you can now call:

    raco pkg install overscan

And you'll get my code. Follow the installation instructions in the
docs and good luck!

I'll be publishing my retrospective on Overscan on my Drip, so be sure
to subscribe there! Thanks for reading pals!
