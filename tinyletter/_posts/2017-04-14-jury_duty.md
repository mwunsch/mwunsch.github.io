This Week's Program: Apr 10 - Apr 14
====================================

This week, I fulfilled my civic obligation. I was selected as an
alternate juror in a civil case that ended up being settled out of
court. I feel proud knowing that I played my part in the
administration of justice, and prouder having committed code from the
jury assembly room in the New York County Supreme Court Building.

Over the weekend, when I normally do not like to program, I did some
programming. Or at least, I did some programming
with [Automator](https://macosxautomation.com/automator/)
and [Workflow](https://workflow.is) ‚Äî two tools that don't involve
_code_ but nevertheless compose program parts together into larger
programs. I love these tools. In Automator I made
two [macOS Services][services]. Both are useful front-ends to
the [Keybase](https://keybase.io) command line interface for signing
and verifying textual messages. You can find both of these in
my [Keybase public folder](https://keybase.pub/wunsch/).
See [my toot on Mastodon][toot] for some additional context and an
animated gif of the signing Service in action. In Workflow, I made a
thing so that I can subscribe to RSS feeds
in [Feed Wrangler](https://feedwrangler.net) quickly on my iPad. I'll
share that out if anyone is interested. Mastodon has given me some
good old school web vibes and inspired me to stitch these small
programs together.

Let's talk about [Overscan](https://github.com/mwunsch/overscan).

## Overscan

I think the last few letters of mine have been difficult to
follow. This project is a study
in [Yak Shaving](http://catb.org/jargon/html/Y/yak-shaving.html).

Here's a review:

+ I am learning the [**Racket**](http://racket-lang.org) programming
  language. This will be my third Lisp (after learning just enough
  Emacs Lisp to be productive and
  building [`sonic-sketches`](https://github.com/mwunsch/sonic-sketches)
  in Clojure).
+ The project I'm writing in Racket is `overscan`, a live-coding
  environment for broadcasting video. The idea is to build an
  environment like [Overtone](http://overtone.github.io)
  or [Extempore](http://extempore.moso.com.au) but focused on
  streaming live video to platforms like Twitch or Facebook
  Live: evaluate a [sexp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression)
  and change the broadcast.
+ To start, I'm going to be writing some Racket bindings to
  the [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org) multimedia
  framework, written in **C**
  and [GLib](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GLib).
+ Instead of writing a bunch of FFI bindings manually for GStreamer
  (aka _GST_), I decided to
  use
  [GObject Introspection](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GObjectIntrospection) (aka
  _GIR_). GIR provides a bridge between a GLib library and another
  language by exposing an API to read metadata from the library and
  dynamically construct bindings.
+ There already is a [GIR](https://docs.racket-lang.org/gir/) package
  for Racket, but it hasn't been updated or maintained in nearly a
  year, and I've found numerous inconsistent and buggy behaviors with
  it. I've decided to write my own GIR bindings in Racket to use as a
  basis for my GST integration. That's where I am now.

So now you're caught up on what exactly I'm doing with all this
Racket‚ÜîC interop. Soon, I'll pop out of this level of the stack and
get to GStreamer and maybe actually producing a video. I've cleared a
lot of the way through my GObject Introspection bindings and have an
API that I'm feeling better about and refining along the way.

The last real major hurdle to go here is to represent the most
relevant binding: bindings
for
[GObjects](https://developer.gnome.org/gobject/stable/pr01.html). Once
those are in place I will be able to move on to integrating GStreamer.

Here are some highlights‚Ä¶

## [acd9682ad477723de02c11a208314903dac5b8fb][gtype-instance]

I create a new struct, `gtype-instance`, which represent C pointers to
GTypes. Racket's FFI library has some ingenious ways of dealing with C
values, and my favorite is the [`cpointer`][cpointer] construct. These
represent pointers that have a _tag_ associated with them, and when
going from Racket to C, if that tag is not present Racket will error
out. When creating C Types with Racket FFI, you provide two functions:
A Racket ‚Üí C function that will coerce a Racket value into the
appropriate representation, and a C ‚Üí Racket function that takes that
representation and returns a suitable value.

So what I've done here is create a C Type that will be converted into
an instance of `gtype-instance` when used within Racket, but will be
coerced back into a pointer for use in C. It's really easy to coerce
back into a pointer form, because Racket structs can behave like C
pointers when they have the `prop:cpointer` property.

## [a9092e219acb4230981f76cf0016df4e1950da56][gstruct-instance]

This is exploited here, where I create a sub-struct of
`gtype-instance`, `gstruct-instance`. This is effectively a decorator
around a pointer to a C Struct, but when used in Racket you can
observe the fields as a list. `gstruct-instance` also behaves like a
procedure, and so you can call it like one to invoke methods on the
struct.

## [d3cdba396060e83b971852ebb9cb7f0b0f1159e1][enum]

`Enums` are the next C type to get bindings. When used in C, these are
effectively `longs`. When coerced into Racket, that `long` is used to
lookup the symbol value. So when you call a C function that returns an
Enum, what you get back is a symbol of the value of that enum! Making
these C Types within Racket is neat!

Also, see that git commit message?

> I'm committing this from the NY County Supreme Court because I'm in
> Jury Duty!

I am a cool dude.

There's a bunch more commits but they're iterations on a lot of the
concepts I've laid out already. I make sure that type information and
conversions are conserved when converting from one of my home-rolled C
Types to the types that are represented in the Type Union used when
invoking functions. I move the file into its final position:
`ffi/unsafe/introspection.rkt`. I create an abstraction for something
that occurs again and again in GIR, building up a list of items from
two functions: one that returns the number of items and the other that
returns the item at a given index:

    (define (gi-build-list info numproc getter)
      (build-list (numproc info)
                  (curry getter info)))

I make sure that `gi-base-info` base info values are always
deallocated appropriately. And finally I convert the overscan package
to be a "multi" collection in Racket's package management parlance.

Next week, GObjects and signals, API hardening, and documentation.
