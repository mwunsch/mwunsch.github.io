This Week's Program: Jan 9 - Jan 31
===================================

[Last week][last-week], one of the things I resolved to do in 2017 was
to spend some time learning and using [**D3**](https://d3js.org). This
was my focus this week.

I decided that for my first exploration into D3, I would use the
metrics and stats of this Tinyletter as a basis for my data
analysis. I have occasionally shared details and numbers about my
readership. I subscribe to a handful of Tinyletters; I really have no
idea where mine ranks in terms of subscribers and engagement. I have
been a poor email marketer.

The first step was to find and extract some metrics for transformation
into a data format that D3 can handle. I started by scraping the
Tinyletter web application with a bit of jQuery, `JSON.stringify`, and
the `copy` function (a handy utility made available in the Google Web
Developer console). A JSON Array of Arrays can be transformed into a
CSV using [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) with:

    jq -r '.[] @csv'

It turns out, I could do much better than scraping thanks to the
wonderful [`tinystats`][tinystats] command line utility, which
provides several useful reports (see also the
associated [`tinyapi`][tinyapi] Python library).

`tinystats` combined with [`csvkit`][csvkit] got me just the right
data to begin experimenting with visualization.

[**Here is my first D3 project.**][d3] A column chart showing my subscriber
count over time. Each letter is represented by a bar, with a time
series going across the x axis. The color of the bar represents the
open rate for the letter, with the brighter color representing a
higher open rate.

For this project, I got to familiarize myself with a bunch of
different subcomponents of D3
including [scales](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale)
and [axes](https://github.com/d3/d3-axis). I also decided to use some
native [ES6 features][arrow], so this might not show up at all in some
browsers.

D3 is less of a data visualization framework and more of a toolkit of
associated libraries that join data to HTML or SVG nodes. Having done
a lot of work with SVG in Elm, I was feeling much more comfortable
approaching this project. I struggled for a bit with one of D3's
foundational concepts: [the data join][datajoin]. I
found [this article](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/circles/) really
helpful to get my mind wrapped around the concept.

I'm hosting this D3 project on [Bl.ocks](https://bl.ocks.org/-/about),
which is a really handy way to host code from a GitHub Gist.

So what did I learn from my data visualization? Color is probably not
the best way to visualize something like open rate. What this
visualization tells me is perhaps that my earlier subscribers are the
ones that tend to open my emails. I have, on average, 43 unique opens
for each email. I'm not sure if that's above or below the open rate
for an average Tinyletter. Looking at my visualization, I also can't
tell what open rate correlates to. Subject line? Time of day the
letter is sent? When the subscriber signed up? I'll have to run some
more reports and do some more visualizations to better understand
those things. This is not a very useful visualization.

But for now, I'm satisfied. I immersed myself in D3 and feel like it's
something I have at least a decent grasp of. As I learn more about
_how_ to visualize data, I feel comfortable knowing that I have a
toolset within reach that lets me implement those ideas.

Over the next few weeks, I'm going to be picking up Ansible again for
managing my FreeBSD server, and I'll begin learning the basic building
blocks of Racket. I'll also be writing up a post-mortem on `hive-city`
and my work with Elm.

Have a good weekend<br />
