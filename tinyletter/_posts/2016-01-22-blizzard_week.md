This Week's Program: Jan 18 - Jan 22
====================================

As the denizens of NYC buy up all the bread and milk in the city for
the coming blizzard, I'm at [IndieWebCamp NYC][indiewebcamp]. I
presented the syndication system that I use to publish to Tumblr and
TinyLetter. I hope to expand that system over the course of the
camp. The week flew by. Here's some code!

Uploading to Amazon S3 was really easy. I was shocked. I'm using the
[Amazonica](https://github.com/mcohen01/amazonica) Clojure library,
which is a handy idiomatic wrapper for the official Amazon Java SDK.

I extracted s3 upload to a new function, and use Clojure's handy
threading macro.

So now, running my program will record Auld Lang Syne and upload it
right to an s3 bucket.

I'm going to take a small break from this repository, I think, while I
learn a bit more about building up synths in SuperCollider and
learning more music theory.

I also spent some time this week caring and feeding for websites.

Stay warm,<br />
