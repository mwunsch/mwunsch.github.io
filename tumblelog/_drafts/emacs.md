title: Emacs
---

After an extended *getting-to-know-you* period and a lot of false
starts, I am now using Emacs as my preferred text editor. I came from
Vim. I accept that I will be branded as a heretic by some. I accept
that I will be branded as a Johnny-come-lately by others. I accept
that there are those that will just look at me and think, "Oh great
another neck-bearded eccentric weirdo." To all I say "YOLO."

To say that I am now using Emacs as my "preferred text editor" is
dancing around the edge of truth. Really, I am using Emacs as my
preferred base of operations, from which anything and everything could
begin. Oh and you can edit text, too.
