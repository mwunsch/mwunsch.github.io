Inspired by John Resig's [Write Code Every Day](http://ejohn.org/blog/write-code-every-day/),
I have been writing code every weekday. I have been on a continuous streak for nearly four months.

![From June 15 to Today I've committed code publicly every weekday]({{site.url}}/img/the-streak.png)

I made a conscious decision to publicly commit a snippet of code every day.
As an engineering manager, I do more thinking about code in the abstract then writing it.
I've got a lot of things I'd like to do, though. Little experiments, forays into new languages
and frameworks, small productivity boosts... I've had trouble taking positive steps toward
accomplishing these goals. By commiting to writing and committing code every day, I can make
bite-sized progress. I have always had grandeous visions of my side-projects that result
in inaction: "I can't even get started until *some unreasonable preqrequisite has been met*."
There's nothing grandeous about writing code. It happens line by line, expression by expression.
Committing something every day means I am always making some progress, even if that progress
seems small. I don't want to break the streak.

It started by making changes to my personal website. Now I'm working on transitioning to Emacs.
Soon, I'll be embarking on other projects.
It's okay if progress appears miniscule -- that's preferable to no progress at all.

Streaks are good for building habits, but insisting on an unbroken streak seems a bit unreasonable to me.
I don't think I want to write code on vacations.

If you're interested in the code I write, I started a [weekly email newsletter](http://tinyletter.com/wunsch) to talk about what I'm working on and why I'm working on it.

The weekends are not for computers.
